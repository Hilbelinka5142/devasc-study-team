# What I have learned about git and github

From going through this lab I was able to better understand using git and github.

I leanred that it is pretty easy being able to work on your local machine with writing programs and files and then being able to just type in a line of code to upload all of those to a online repo for other people to have access too.

There are many different things you are able to do with git and then being able to use them locally and then share all that with other people is really cool
